ðŸ“„ Abstract
The present study investigated young childrenâ€™s causal generalizations by examining their inductions from second-order learningâ€”where learned correlations between two pairs of features (Aâ€“B and Aâ€“C) are generalized to non-contiguous features (Bâ€“C). Specifically, we asked whether 3- to 6-year-olds could engage in such learning across two canonical causal event typesâ€”Blicket detector and Michottian launchingâ€”while manipulating contact as a perceptual cue for causality. We replicated Benton, Rakison, and Sobel (2021), finding that children consistently applied second-order learning to infer which objects would produce causal outcomes. Crucially, childrenâ€™s responses did not differ overall between event types. However, there was a significant interaction by age and task condition: younger children learned better when objects did not contact, whereas older children learned better from contact events. Results are discussed with respect to implications for the development of childrenâ€™s causal expectations.
